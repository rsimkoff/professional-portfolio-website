<H1>About Me</H1>    
<section>This is the start of my professional Portfolio. 
    I want to build a number of Applications to show my growing expertize in development. 
    I am a Georgia State grad with a bachelors in finance.
    I have 2+ years of professional experience in corporate accounting. I made the switch out of an interest to pursue a career in technology.
    The four projects listed below are either in progress, or future ideas of good applications to build my programming knowledge.</p>

                    A future project idea using fantasy basketball player statistics
                    as a database to practice sorting algorithms and conditional statements for arrays.
                    Application could feature sorting players by points, injury status, and team.

                    Another good starter project will be building
                    a functional scientific calculator, featuring addition,
                    subtraction, division, and multiplication functions using both
                    whole integers and decimals.
